# Data Science with Python

This is the practical cases for Python training I provide.

## Environment setup

As usual, create a virtual environment and get the dependencies with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Working environment

We'll use *Jupyter Notebooks* in this training. For more information, you cas
check the project page [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/). Jupyter is included in the requirements.
 
From the project root, launch

```
jupyter notebook
```

or

```
jupyter-lab
```

You can also open notebooks from your IDE. VS Code supports notebooks but for
PyCharm, you'll need the pro version.

## Ressources

The *assets* directory contains files from the [SNCF OpenData](https://data.sncf.com/) which is the
owner of those files. SNCF is the French railway company.
